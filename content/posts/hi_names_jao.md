I'm a Brazilian software developer that, in the time of this post, I'm 20 years old and at my first year of my computer science undergraduate degree.
I wrote my first line of code in the [C language](https://learn.microsoft.com/pt-br/cpp/c-language/?view=msvc-170) at 16, just a simple hello world, that made me waste 2 hours and almost give up, but when i did:
<div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:42%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/Z6f7vzq3iP6Mw" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" allowFullScreen></iframe></div>

Everyone should remember they first hello world, right?
But that was not when i became a programmer... as you can clearly see in my commit history at mine [github](https://github.com/jaoleal) i had long breaks in programming just because i was'nt really sure of what the hell as going on. But all my free times among school and work, i keep studying and just listening to other programmers talking about programming shit.

One of my favorite was [Fabio Akita](https://www.youtube.com/@Akitando), if you understand portuguese take a look at his channel.

I can surely say that i became a programmer when i got close to my cousin [Jose Storopoli](https://github.com/storopoli), he is the most dedicated programmer that i know (and the best one too btw), so take a look at his work on his 
[github](https://github.com/storopoli) and [blog](https://storopoli.io/) is totally worth the time, he love javascript (trust me ðŸ˜‚).

Back on track, Jose introduced me to [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/pt-BR), his [book of Julia](https://www.amazon.com/Julia-Data-Science-Portugu%C3%AAs-Portuguese/dp/B09QP69D1T), as you can see, they are the best in what they are made to do

[Julia](https://julialang.org/) make easy-to-do math and is fast as fuck.

Any Rust software is like [bedrock](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Bedrock), will never break thanks to its memory-safety driven architecture and of course is fast as fuck.

Do you know what kind of software needs to be memory efficient and have fast math ? Yes, Games!

## Gaming Development

Of course, Julia have another purpose than be in games.

> Julia is a high-level, general-purpose dynamic programming language, most commonly used for numerical analysis and computational science. at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_(programming_language)).

But talking about fast math was something of my interest.

Rust is slowly walking in game, but not because its bad, but because of the way that the game industry works(and web too), i have some strong opinions about the game industry that i will make a separate blog post to it.
> see [Are We Game Yet ?](https://arewegameyet.rs/)

My personal goal is to be a game developer, but i do not have much choice right now, so im beeing embracing of what i work, what i study and what i do not. Timing is fundamental at the beggining.

## Web Development

Web is not something that triggers me some excitement as Game Development does, but i do like a bit(I am making a blog duhr).

Actually, i do believe that web is the future of computers programs, at least 90% of them, more precisely this future will be when javascript die, or just be used to call WASM.

Talking about WASM, that one is a game changer, i will talk briefly about it right now, but i will make a separate blog post just for it.

WASM is the good way to do web apps, it is fast, it is secure, it is memory efficient and we can use some good programming languages, not javascript.
I will proudly share this mine [Rust-C-Wasm project](https://github.com/jaoleal/Rust-C-Wasm), go take some time to read about it.

That is not everything that i do with Rust, i do some bitcoin studying too!

## Bitcoin Development

Dispise your political opinion, Bitcoin is the future of money, it secure, it is decentralized, it is(mostly) tax free, what make Bitcoin the best and cheapest way to work-around with money.

The technology behind it is just amazing and every developer should learn a little about it.

Right now, when i am writing this, i do make part of the [Vinteum](https://vinteum.org/) and i am applying to [Summer of Bitcoin](https://www.summerofbitcoin.org/)

## Phew
As you can see, i do a lot of things, and i didn't even say everything that i want, but surely i will do! And not just about programming, but everything that i like and find interesting to talk about.
